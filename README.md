#  E-Commerce Analysis

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and customer segmentation for an e-commerce dataset. The objective is to derive actionable business insights and classify customers into meaningful segments based on transactional behavior.

## Contents

### Data
- **Customers.csv**: Contains demographic details and other information about the customers.
- **Products.csv**: Includes data about the products available on the platform.
- **Transactions.csv**: Transactional data capturing customer purchases and product information.

### Notebooks
- **EDA.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, visualization, and deriving insights.

### Reports
- **Business Insights Report EDA1.docx**: A document summarizing key insights and trends discovered during the EDA phase.
- **Clustering Results & Customer Segmentation.docx**: Detailed results on clustering and customer segmentation using machine learning techniques.
